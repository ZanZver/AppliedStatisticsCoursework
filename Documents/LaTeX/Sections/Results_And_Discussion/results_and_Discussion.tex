Conduct the statistical analysis and report the results. Show how the statistical assumptions required for applying a statistical test are fulfilled. Discuss and evaluate the results to effectively answer the questions outlined earlier; \newline
o	Detail the results in tables and figures as appropriate. Each table and figure must be numbered, and must have appropriate legends (if required) and captions. The captions must be a set of grammatically complete sentences (up to 3 lines long) that concisely describe the information in the tables and the figures. No such table and figure should be included that is not discussed in the text. The numerical comparisons should be supported by appropriate tests of statistical significance.
